# Portfolio v1
## Why?
I created this project in order to see how to create a fullstack web application and also in order to show a bit what work I am doing.
## Stack
It was important for me to use a stack I am not really comfortable with and therefore I started out with Golang for the backend and basic react in the frontend. 
## What does the project consist of?
The frontend consists out of a portfolio part and a blog site.
