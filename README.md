# Portfolio v1
## What
I created this project in order to learn how to create a fullstack web application - the intention was to create a portfolio website with a blog, also some authentication should be included but I stopped working on the project before I came to that part. At least I implemented a frontend for it ðŸ˜†.
## Stack
- MongoDB that holds the blogs
- Golang for the backend
- Javscript with React for the frontend (Compiling with webpack and babel)
- node v14
